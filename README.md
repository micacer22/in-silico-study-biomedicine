# **The Role of Small RNAs in the Epigenetic Control of Plant Virus-Responsive Genes**  

## **Description**  
This project investigates the role of small RNAs (sRNAs) in the epigenetic regulation of virus-responsive genes in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. It analyzes the differential expression of sRNAs in epigenetic mutants and their relationship with nearby transposable elements (TEs).  

## **Project Structure**  
ðŸ“‚ **data/** â€“ Input files, including sequencing data.  
ðŸ“‚ **scripts/** â€“ Bash and R scripts for data analysis.  
ðŸ“‚ **results/** â€“ Intermediate and final analysis results.  
ðŸ“„ **README.md** â€“ This document.  
ðŸ“„ **main.tex** â€“ Main LaTeX manuscript file.  

## **Requirements**  
- Operating system: Linux or macOS (HPC with SLURM recommended).  
- Required bioinformatics tools:  
  - FastQC  
  - Trim Galore  
  - MultiQC  
  - ShortStack  
  - Samtools  
  - IGV  
  - featureCounts  
  - R (packages: `DESeq2`, `edgeR`)  

## **Usage Instructions**  

### **1. Download Data**  
Run the script to download sRNA sequencing data from GEO/SRA:  
```bash
bash scripts/download_srna_data.sh
```

### **2. Quality Control and Preprocessing**  
```bash
bash scripts/preprocessing.sh
```

### **3. Sequence Alignment**  
```bash
bash scripts/alignment.sh
```

### **4. Differential Expression Analysis**  
Run in R:  
```r
source("scripts/diff_expression_analysis.R")
```

### **5. Visualization in IGV**  
Load the BAM files into IGV to explore expression patterns.  

## **Expected Results**  
- Identification of differentially expressed sRNAs in epigenetic mutants.  
- Analysis of the relationship between TEs and virus-responsive genes.  
- Integration of methylation and expression data.
